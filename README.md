Toy example of python application that retrievs CVs from a local disk that contain specific text. It uses [pytesseract](https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract), a python wrapper for [Google's Tesseract-OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract). To illustrate the concept some CVs found using google images are used.
